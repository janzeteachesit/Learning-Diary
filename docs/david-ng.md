I read (or try to) what he has written
- [Teacher Certification Exams May Be Too Easy — but They’re Also Not That Important - Bright](https://brightreads.com/teacher-certification-exams-may-be-too-easy-but-theyre-also-not-that-important-93add988d701)
  - "Teachers should be learners first."
  - "Sadly ... few schools have the culture or capacity to function as learning organizations."
  - "... experiments had to be shared, replicated, and evaluated so we could decide, collectively, if a new strategy should be adopted school-wide. This was consistency implemented from the bottom up, not imposed from the top down."
- [Making Sense of Place Value](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/making-sense-of-place-value-fb2e27499d4f)
  - "Chocolate Chip Cookie Factory: Place Value, on the App Store."
  - link to CodePen
- [How Might a Culture of Powerful Ideas Emerge?](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/how-might-a-culture-of-powerful-ideas-emerge-aa41507cd1b8)
  - "What kind of culture of powerful ideas must we create?"
- [Seeking Mountains; Will Travel](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/seeking-mountains-will-travel-11b1fb13341e)
  - "In these panels, traveling to a destination is a metaphor for learning while mountain climbing is a metaphor for vertical learning. If lifelong learners constantly travel to new destinations, vertical learners constantly scale new and taller mountains."
